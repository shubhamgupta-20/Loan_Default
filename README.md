# Loan_Default
Analysed the data using EDA to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected 

- Identified two secnarios:
(a) The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan.
(b) All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.

- Identified patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
